**flua** - Fortran 2003 bindings for Lua 5.1
========================================

**flua** implements fortran bidings for lua based on the fortran 2003 
**iso_c_compatability** interface. Many of the API calls are implemented,
although some of the api elements could not be implemented directly
due to differences between c and fortran data structured. For example,
fortran does not use the same way of representing character arrays as
c, so some effort is required to translate between c compatible 
character arrays and fortran character arrays.

**flua** is an extension of the **f2k3-lua** project which exposes a
portion of the lua api that is useful for leading configuration
files.
